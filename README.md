# lpgDebian

Installation of my environment using Debian as a base.

## Install

Install [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) in its minimal version, just with `standard system utilities`

With the installation finished, login and follow the following commands:

```sh
su -
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/lpg2709/lpgDebian
cd lpgDebian && ./install.sh
```

This will prepare the system for installation, after system reboot, enter your root password, the procedure will continue.
